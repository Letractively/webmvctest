This document describes how to use the webMVCTest application and test an MVN website

= Command line =
When you build the application it produces a console application. Use it the following way:

WebMVNTest.exe [-r] [-l] [-d] [-t <testSet>] fileName.xml

Options are:
 * -r report the results in a PDF
 * -d add debugging output
 * -l add logging output to file
 * -t <testSet] test only a specific testSet. Useful when building your test project.
